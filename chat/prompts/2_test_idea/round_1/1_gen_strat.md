title: >-
  The Dual Stratification Hypothesis: How Education and Income Inequality Co-Evolve to Undermine Democratic Resilience
hypothesis: >-
  Among post-1990 democratizers, the interaction between income inequality and education inequality creates a 'dual stratification'
  equilibrium that accelerates democratic backsliding. Welfare state spending on education acts as a buffer - when public
  education spending exceeds 5% of GDP, the interaction between income inequality and education inequality becomes non-significant.
  The mechanism operates through de facto political power: education inequality enables elites to capture democratic institutions
  even under formal democracy, as measured by V-Dem's political equality index.
motivation: >-
  While recent work establishes income inequality as a predictor of democratic backsliding (PNAS 2025), and Acemoglu & Robinson's
  framework emphasizes de facto vs. de jure power, no study has tested whether education inequality AMPLIFIES income inequality's
  effect on backsliding. This is theoretically important because: (1) Education inequality may matter MORE than income inequality
  for democratic resilience, as education affects political sophistication and who can run for office; (2) The co-evolution
  of both inequalities creates persistent elite capture (Acemoglu & Robinson 2008); (3) Welfare state spending on education
  could break this equilibrium, but this has not been tested at scale. For comparative political economy, this identifies
  a specific mechanism (de facto power distribution) through which inequality undermines democracy, and a specific policy
  lever (education spending) to sustain democratic resilience.
assumptions:
- >-
  Post-1990 democratizers share sufficient institutional variation to identify effects (tested via included country fixed
  effects)
- >-
  V-Dem's political equality index validly measures de facto power distribution (established in V-Dem codebook v.14)
- >-
  Education inequality can be proxied by tertiary enrollment rates and average years of education (direct inequality measures
  by SES not available in OWID, but proxies correlate with inequality in developed democracies)
- >-
  Welfare state spending on education is exogenous to short-term democratic backsliding (tested via lagged specifications)
- >-
  The de facto power mechanism operates at the national level (not just individual level)
investigation_approach: |-
  1. DATA: Merge OWID panels - V-Dem v.14 (liberal democracy index, political equality index), World Bank PIP (Gini coefficients), UNESCO education data (tertiary enrollment, average years), OECD SOCX (public education spending %GDP), Lindert social spending data. Sample: 35-40 post-1990 democratizers, 1990-2024 panel.
  2. IDENTIFICATION: Panel fixed-effects models with lagged dependent variable (Arellano-Bond GMM) to test: (a) Main effect of Gini on V-Dem liberal democracy index; (b) Interaction effect of Gini × education inequality; (c) Mediation via political equality index (Sobel-Goodman test); (d) Moderation via education spending (triple interaction: Gini × education inequality × education spending).
  3. ROBUSTNESS: (a) Alternative inequality measures (SWIID); (b) Alternative democracy measures (Polity V, EIU); (c) Placebo tests (pre-1990 period should show no effect); (d) Instrumental variable approach using lagged education inequality as instrument.
success_criteria: |-
  Hypothesis is CONFIRMED if: (1) Interaction term Gini × education inequality is negative and significant (p < 0.05) for predicting V-Dem liberal democracy decline; (2) Political equality index mediates this relationship (Sobel test p < 0.05); (3) Triple interaction Gini × education inequality × education spending is positive and significant (buffer effect).
  Hypothesis is DISCONFIRMED if: (1) No significant interaction (only main effects); (2) Education spending does not moderate the relationship; (3) De facto power (political equality) does not mediate.

- >-
  PNAS 2025 'Income inequality and the erosion of democracy in the twenty-first century' (Haggard, Pennington, et al.): Establishes
  income inequality as predictor of democratic backsliding using V-Dem data. OUR DIFFERENCE: We test education inequality's
  INTERACTION with income inequality, not just main effect of income. Also, we identify mechanism (de facto power) and mediator
  (welfare spending).
- >-
  Acemoglu & Robinson (2008) 'Persistence of Power, Elites, and Institutions' (AER): Theoretically models how de facto power
  offsets de jure political power changes. OUR DIFFERENCE: We provide the first EMPIRICAL TEST of how education inequality
  affects de facto power distribution and subsequent democratic backsliding, using new V-Dem political equality data not available
  when A&R wrote.
- >-
  Baliamoune-Lutz (2018) 'Political Elites, Democracy and Education': Theoretical model on elite's education subsidy decisions
  under de facto power. OUR DIFFERENCE: We test the REVERSE causal direction - how education inequality (not elite's subsidies)
  affects democratic backsliding via de facto power - and use macro panel data across 35+ countries, not just Africa.
- >-
  Iversen & Soskice (2006) 'Education, Inequality, and Social Protection': Links education systems to inequality and welfare
  states. OUR DIFFERENCE: We focus on democratic BACKSLIDING (not just redistribution), use post-1990 democratizers (not just
  OECD), and test de facto power as mechanism (not just political preferences).
- >-
  Zuazu (2018) V-Dem Working Paper 'Electoral Systems and Income Inequality': Tests how political equality (de facto power)
  affects inequality. OUR DIFFERENCE: We reverse the causality - testing how inequality (income + education) affects political
  equality and democratic backsliding, not the other way.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis synthesizes three insights from comparative political economy: (1) Acemoglu & Robinson's de facto vs. de
  jure power framework (theoretically established but rarely tested directly with new V-Dem political equality data); (2)
  The 'dual stratification' concept from stratification economics (joint effects of multiple inequalities); (3) The welfare
  state as 'democratic insurance' - extending Iversen & Soskice's skill formation framework to focus on democratic resilience,
  not just redistribution. The cross-domain inspiration comes from 'persistence' models in macroeconomics (how multiple equilibria
  form and what shifts them) applied to political institutions.
terms:
- term: Dual Stratification
  definition: >-
    The co-occurrence of high income inequality and high education inequality, creating a persistent elite-dominated equilibrium
    that resists democratic deepening
- term: De Facto Political Power
  definition: >-
    Political influence arising from wealth, organization, education, or social networks, as distinct from de jure power allocated
    by political institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson 2008)
- term: Political Equality Index (V-Dem)
  definition: >-
    V-Dem measure (v2pepwrsoc) of the extent to which political power is evenly distributed across socioeconomic groups, ranging
    from 0 (elite monopoly) to 4 (equal power)
- term: Democratic Backsliding
  definition: >-
    The state-led debilitation or elimination of political institutions sustaining democratic control over executive power,
    including civil liberties, free elections, and rule of law (Lührmann & Lindberg 2019)
- term: Post-1990 Democratizers
  definition: >-
    Countries that transitioned to democracy after 1989, including post-communist states, Latin American countries in the
    Third Wave, and sub-Saharan African democratizers in the 1990s
- term: Welfare State Buffer
  definition: >-
    The hypothesis that generous welfare state spending (especially on education) reduces the political power asymmetry created
    by income and education inequality, thereby sustaining democratic quality
summary: >-
  Among post-1990 democratizers, the interaction of income and education inequality creates 'dual stratification' that accelerates
  democratic backsliding by enabling elite capture via de facto power. Welfare state education spending breaks this equilibrium.
  Tested using OWID panels (V-Dem, World Bank PIP, UNESCO, OECD SOCX) with panel GMM and mediation analysis.

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-17 02:24:47 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```
