kind: hypothesis
title: >-
  The Dual Stratification Hypothesis: How Education and Income Inequality Co-Evolve to Undermine Democratic Resilience
hypothesis: >-
  Among post-1990 democratizers, the interaction between income inequality and education inequality creates a 'dual stratification'
  equilibrium that accelerates democratic backsliding. Welfare state spending on education acts as a buffer - when public
  education spending exceeds 5% of GDP, the interaction between income inequality and education inequality becomes non-significant.
  The mechanism operates through de facto political power: education inequality enables elites to capture democratic institutions
  even under formal democracy, as measured by V-Dem's political equality index.
motivation: >-
  While recent work establishes income inequality as a predictor of democratic backsliding (PNAS 2025), and Acemoglu & Robinson's
  framework emphasizes de facto vs. de jure power, no study has tested whether education inequality AMPLIFIES income inequality's
  effect on backsliding. This is theoretically important because: (1) Education inequality may matter MORE than income inequality
  for democratic resilience, as education affects political sophistication and who can run for office; (2) The co-evolution
  of both inequalities creates persistent elite capture (Acemoglu & Robinson 2008); (3) Welfare state spending on education
  could break this equilibrium, but this has not been tested at scale. For comparative political economy, this identifies
  a specific mechanism (de facto power distribution) through which inequality undermines democracy, and a specific policy
  lever (education spending) to sustain democratic resilience.
assumptions:
- >-
  Post-1990 democratizers share sufficient institutional variation to identify effects (tested via included country fixed
  effects)
- >-
  V-Dem's political equality index validly measures de facto power distribution (established in V-Dem codebook v.14)
- >-
  Education inequality can be proxied by tertiary enrollment rates and average years of education (direct inequality measures
  by SES not available in OWID, but proxies correlate with inequality in developed democracies)
- >-
  Welfare state spending on education is exogenous to short-term democratic backsliding (tested via lagged specifications)
- >-
  The de facto power mechanism operates at the national level (not just individual level)
investigation_approach: |-
  1. DATA: Merge OWID panels - V-Dem v.14 (liberal democracy index, political equality index), World Bank PIP (Gini coefficients), UNESCO education data (tertiary enrollment, average years), OECD SOCX (public education spending %GDP), Lindert social spending data. Sample: 35-40 post-1990 democratizers, 1990-2024 panel.
  2. IDENTIFICATION: Panel fixed-effects models with lagged dependent variable (Arellano-Bond GMM) to test: (a) Main effect of Gini on V-Dem liberal democracy index; (b) Interaction effect of Gini × education inequality; (c) Mediation via political equality index (Sobel-Goodman test); (d) Moderation via education spending (triple interaction: Gini × education inequality × education spending).
  3. ROBUSTNESS: (a) Alternative inequality measures (SWIID); (b) Alternative democracy measures (Polity V, EIU); (c) Placebo tests (pre-1990 period should show no effect); (d) Instrumental variable approach using lagged education inequality as instrument.
success_criteria: |-
  Hypothesis is CONFIRMED if: (1) Interaction term Gini × education inequality is negative and significant (p < 0.05) for predicting V-Dem liberal democracy decline; (2) Political equality index mediates this relationship (Sobel test p < 0.05); (3) Triple interaction Gini × education inequality × education spending is positive and significant (buffer effect).
  Hypothesis is DISCONFIRMED if: (1) No significant interaction (only main effects); (2) Education spending does not moderate the relationship; (3) De facto power (political equality) does not mediate.

  PNAS 2025 'Income inequality and the erosion of democracy in the twenty-first century' (Haggard, Pennington, et al.): Establishes
  income inequality as predictor of democratic backsliding using V-Dem data. OUR DIFFERENCE: We test education inequality's
  INTERACTION with income inequality, not just main effect of income. Also, we identify mechanism (de facto power) and mediator
  (welfare spending).

- >-
  Iversen & Soskice (2006) 'Education, Inequality, and Social Protection': Links education systems to inequality and welfare

- >-
  Zuazu (2018) V-Dem Working Paper 'Electoral Systems and Income Inequality': Tests how political equality (de facto power)
  affects inequality. OUR DIFFERENCE: We reverse the causality - testing how inequality (income + education) affects political
  equality and democratic backsliding, not the other way.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis synthesizes three insights from comparative political economy: (1) Acemoglu & Robinson's de facto vs. de
  jure power framework (theoretically established but rarely tested directly with new V-Dem political equality data); (2)
  The 'dual stratification' concept from stratification economics (joint effects of multiple inequalities); (3) The welfare
  state as 'democratic insurance' - extending Iversen & Soskice's skill formation framework to focus on democratic resilience,
  not just redistribution. The cross-domain inspiration comes from 'persistence' models in macroeconomics (how multiple equilibria
  form and what shifts them) applied to political institutions.
terms:
- term: Dual Stratification
  definition: >-
    The co-occurrence of high income inequality and high education inequality, creating a persistent elite-dominated equilibrium
    that resists democratic deepening
- term: De Facto Political Power
  definition: >-
    Political influence arising from wealth, organization, education, or social networks, as distinct from de jure power allocated
    by political institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson 2008)
- term: Political Equality Index (V-Dem)
  definition: >-
    V-Dem measure (v2pepwrsoc) of the extent to which political power is evenly distributed across socioeconomic groups, ranging
    from 0 (elite monopoly) to 4 (equal power)
- term: Democratic Backsliding
  definition: >-
    The state-led debilitation or elimination of political institutions sustaining democratic control over executive power,
    including civil liberties, free elections, and rule of law (Lührmann & Lindberg 2019)
- term: Post-1990 Democratizers
  definition: >-
    Countries that transitioned to democracy after 1989, including post-communist states, Latin American countries in the
    Third Wave, and sub-Saharan African democratizers in the 1990s
- term: Welfare State Buffer
  definition: >-
    The hypothesis that generous welfare state spending (especially on education) reduces the political power asymmetry created
    by income and education inequality, thereby sustaining democratic quality
summary: >-
  Among post-1990 democratizers, the interaction of income and education inequality creates 'dual stratification' that accelerates
  democratic backsliding by enabling elite capture via de facto power. Welfare state education spending breaks this equilibrium.
  Tested using OWID panels (V-Dem, World Bank PIP, UNESCO, OECD SOCX) with panel GMM and mediation analysis.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Construct and validate a merged panel dataset of post-1990 democratizers (1990-2024) combining V-Dem political equality
  and liberal democracy indices, World Bank PIP Gini coefficients, UNESCO education indicators, and OECD SOCX/public education
  spending data.
approach: >-
  Use aii-owid-datasets and aii-hf-datasets skills to search for and download: (1) V-Dem v.14 data (v2x_libdem, v2pepwrsoc),
  (2) World Bank PIP Gini coefficients, (3) UNESCO Institute for Statistics education data (tertiary enrollment, mean years
  of schooling), (4) OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) education spending. Identify post-1990 democratizers using V-Dem
  regime transition dates. Merge on country-year, handle missing data via balanced panel selection. After assembly, conduct
  EDA: descriptive stats, correlation matrices, missing data patterns, temporal coverage plots. Output: standardized JSON
  with schema validation via aii-json, plus EDA summary documenting country coverage and data quality.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-17 02:26:12 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-06-17 02:26:34 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

---

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --num-rows 3' ::: 'openai/gsm8k' 'imdb' 'squad'
```

**Example output:**

- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

name: aii-owid-datasets
description: Search and load datasets from Our World in Data catalog using BM25 search. Returns actual table data (default limit 3) with metadata, preview, and mini dataset. Use for global statistics on energy, health, COVID-19, economics, environment, demographics.

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase table discovery process)
- Scripts (Search, Download with full parameters)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 2-Phase Table Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Tables
Find tables with metadata (title, description, variables)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "renewable energy" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Download Table (if suitable)
Download the table after reviewing the search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OWID tables (aii_owid_search_datasets.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "climate change" --limit 3
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 3' ::: 'renewable energy' 'climate change' 'covid mortality'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 OWID tables for 'climate change':

[1] Climate Change Impacts
    Path: grapher/climate/2023-10-15/climate_impacts
    Description: Global temperature anomalies and sea level rise...
    Variables (42 total):
      - Global temperature anomaly (°C): Annual global mean temperature anomaly
      - Sea level rise (mm): Global mean sea level change
      - Atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm): Monthly CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa
      - Arctic sea ice extent (million km²): Monthly Arctic sea ice extent
      ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (required, positional)
- Search query string
- Examples: `"covid"`, `"energy mix"`, `"climate change"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Number of search results to return (default: 3)
- Higher values = more results to choose from

**Tips:**
- Search is fast (uses pre-built BM25 index, no network required)
- Returns metadata only - no data is downloaded
- Use the `path` field from results to download specific tables
- BM25 search ranks by relevance across table titles, descriptions, and variable metadata
- Search returns tables from all channels (garden=highest quality, meadow=raw, backport=legacy, open_numbers=Gapminder)

### Download OWID table (aii_owid_download_datasets.py)

Download a table by path (from search results) and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple tables):**

IMPORTANT: When downloading multiple tables, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix' 'grapher/demography/2023-10-10/population' 'grapher/health/2023-08-01/life_expectancy'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded OWID table: grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix

Dimensions: 15,420 rows x 12 columns
Columns: country, year, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels...

Files saved:
  Mini (READ THIS for development/testing): /path/to/mini_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Preview (DO NOT READ - for logging only): /path/to/preview_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Full (DO NOT READ - for scripts only):    /path/to/full_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json

Sample data (first 3 rows):
  Row 1:
    country: Afghanistan
    year: 2000
    coal: 0.5
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`path` (required, positional)
- Table path from search results
- Examples: `"grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"`, `"garden/demography/2023-10-10/population"`

**Output files (auto-saved to `temp/tables/`):**
1. **Mini**: `mini_{path}.json` - 3 full rows - **READ THIS** for development/testing
2. **Preview**: `preview_{path}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read
3. **Full**: `full_{path}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read

**Tips:**
- **Critical**: Only read the mini file directly with Read tool. Preview and full are input paths for code you write
- Use the `path` from search results to download specific tables
- Downloads directly from OWID catalog (network required)
- Files always saved to `temp/tables/` (path included in response)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
